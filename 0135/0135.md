There is a statement that is alway true for every one in the list.
-   Every child will receive 1 candy (its inevitable)

Now i have to find the odd term. That is neighbours.
There are how many neighbours which rating is greater than his left or his right.

First child only has its right neighbour
and Last child only has its left neighbour


1.  if n (number of child) is 1 then minimum 1 candy is required.
2.  if n is 2
    -   if both ratings are equal then there will be just 2 candy will given
    -   if one of the rating is greater than another then there will be 3 candies will be given.
